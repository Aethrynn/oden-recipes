# oden-recipes

Basic HTML project that contains a main page plus 3 pages for different recipes. The main page has links to each of the recipe pages and each recipe page has a link back to the main page.

Through this project, I was able to practice basic HTML formatting and usage of different header sizes, paragraphs, and lists (both ordered and unordered). I also feel like I started understanding how pages should be linked together.
